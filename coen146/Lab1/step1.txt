For each command:
    Summarize the output generated by the command.
    Explain the purpose and functionality of the command.
    Describe scenarios where the command would be useful in networking tasks.

Example: Command: ping google.com

    The command sends ICMP packets to google.com (server) and receive ECHO_RESPONSE packets.
    The output shows the round-trip time, packet loss percentage, and total time.
    ping is generally used to test the reachability of a host on a network and measure the time it takes for packets to travel to the host and come back. Network administrators use ping to troubleshoot connectivity issues, check network latency, and verify the status of a remote server.


Command: netstat
    The command displays the network status and protocol statistics
    Used to examine network connections and statistics
    netstat is useful when monitoring network usage and troubleshooting network connectivity


Command: ifconfig
    The command display the current network interface's configuration and status 
    The output includes a list of connected interfaces along with their status, addresses, and other information
    Useful in debugging interface connections, checking IP addresses, and bringing up or down interfaces during maintenance


Command: hostname
    Returns the hostname of the user
    Used to display or set the system's hostname on the network
    Used to verify or modify the current system's hostname


Command: ping google.com
    Confinually sends packets to server(google.com) and recieves packets
    The output displays the number of packets transmitted and recieved, packet loss percentage, and total time 
    ping is used by network administrators to troubleshoot connectivity issues, check network latency, and verify the status of a remote server.

Command: traceroute google.com
    The output shows each router between this system and google servers as well as the time between each step
    Traceroute shows the path data takes to reach a server and lists each step/router along the way and how long it takes between each stop
    Used to diagnose routing issues and analyze bottlenecks in networks as well as ensuring connection to remote servers through specific routes


Command: telnet google.com 80
    Opens a session using the telnet protocol with a remote server and verifies if connection is possible on port 80(http port)
    The output shows that the system is trying connect to a server(google.com) given a specific port(80)
    telnet tests whether or not a port is open and can be useful when testing connectivity to a remote host given a specific port


Command: host/dig google.com
    Returns IP and IPv6 addresses of given domain(google.com)
    Performs DNS lookups to resolve domain names to IP addresses or vice versa
    Used to verify IP address correctly matches the right domain name and could be used to update DNS for a changed domain name


Command: route
    Shows the system's kernel IP routing table, which includes the destination, gate way and genmask
    route manages the routing table to determine how packets are forwarded through a network
    Ensures proper routing of traffic in large networks or for modifying specific routes for specific destinations


Command: arp
    displays the ARP table which maps IP addresses to Hardwarea addresses
    shows conversion table of IP addresses to HW address 
    This allows for manual entry or deletion of entries of old ARP entries both for connection and security purposes
